Optogram, a DeGoogled Telegram client for Android with Unified-Push, Extra Privacy Features and Black Interface
=======================================================================================
![Picture](images/icon_launcher.png)

The application is for people who choose not to use Google services, including the Firebase Push, which is known 
to expose metadata to various third parties. Without FCM/GCM push, most users must enable 'keep alive' and 
'background connection' features, which cause excessive battery consumption. Not so with Optogram, which uses
Unified Push, which is enabled automatically when using a [companion](https://github.com/optimumpr/ntfy-android/) application Ntfy that
uses publicly available (or your own) push servers. 

Credits: This application won't be possible without F-Droid's TelegramFOSS, Mercurygram and Ntfy application developments.
